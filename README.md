# Eniac Product Discount Analysis

A detailed data analysis project to understand the impact of product discounting at Eniac.

## Overview

There has been an ongoing debate within Eniac about the benefits and drawbacks of offering product discounts. While the Marketing Team Lead believes in the growth potential of discounts, main investors have expressed concerns about potential revenue reduction. This project dives deep into the data to bring clarity to this debate.

## Datasets

- `orders.csv`: Contains information about each order, including order ID, creation date, total amount paid, and order state.
- `orderlines.csv`: Provides details of products involved in each order, including product quantity and unit price.
- `products.csv`: Contains product details like SKU, name, description, stock status, product type, and promotional price.
- `brands.csv`: Lists brand codes and corresponding brand names.

## Analysis Highlights

1. **Sales Volume vs. Discounts**: Analysis showed that discounts have the potential to boost sales volumes.
2. **Revenue Impact**: While discounts increased the number of orders, they also reduced the average revenue per order.
3. **Data-Driven Insights**: The balance between increased sales volume and reduced revenue per order was explored to guide Eniac's discount strategy.

## Conclusions

Discounts at Eniac stimulate sales volumes but also decrease the average revenue per order. A data-driven approach is essential to balance this trade-off and optimize discounts, while also diversifying growth strategies beyond just discounting.

## Recommendations

Eniac should:
1. Implement a data-informed discount strategy using data analysis or A/B testing.
2. Collect more customer data to refine the strategy further.
3. Diversify growth strategies by improving product quality, enhancing customer service, and expanding the product range.
